# DBMS-project
### Description
A semester project for Database Management Systems (CSC-3032-1) The database is based on storing information pertaining to ski clubs. The process of designing the database itself included designing Entity-Relationship (ER) models and reducing those ER models into relational schemas, specifying the domain, referential integrity, and unique constraints. The database was carefully designed for optimal performance and thus indexing was carefully thought out. Then, normalization into Boyceâ€“Codd normal form (BCNF) was done (ensuring lossless decomposition) before implementation to ensure a good design. The schema was implemented using PostgreSQL as the database with a variety of tools, including IntelliJ IDEA, DBbeaver, PGadmin, Ubuntu (Debian-based Linux operating system to execute psql commands). In addition to creating the database, a web interface was built for the purposes of simulating the deployment of the database, demonstrating how the database could be utilized. PHP was used to allow the web page to interact with the database and create dynamic web pages. Since PHP is a server-side scripting language, a web server was necessary for testing. I used an Apache HTTP server deployed locally via XAMMP (while I also copied the database over to our department server for testing). The web pages use the typically HTML, CSS, and JS.
